# Reward program React App
The mock data is structured, expecting the transaction record to hold: 
•	Transaction Id
•	Customer Name
•	Transaction Amount
•	Transaction Date
•	Customer Id
    
When the application first mounts the table will automatically be populated from the received data and automatically calculates each unique customer’s total reward points

Search by Id is implemented and if the customer with the keyed id exists, the table will only filter and show that customer's data, and when the input field gets emptied the data will populate again.

Run `npm start` to launch the application.
